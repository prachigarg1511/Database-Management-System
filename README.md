## 🔹 Project Overview

This repository contains my **DBMS Practical File / Assignment**, which covers the fundamental concepts of Database Management Systems along with hands-on SQL implementations. The purpose of this project is to understand how databases are designed, created, queried, and managed using relational database principles.

The file includes:

* Basic to advanced SQL queries
* Table creation and schema design
* Data manipulation and data retrieval operations
* Use of constraints, functions, and joins
* Practical problems commonly asked in interviews and exams

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of how real-world applications store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

## 🔹 Sample Queries Included

Some important queries implemented in this project:

* Find the **Second Highest Salary**
* Find the **Nth Highest Salary using Functions**
* Calculate **Annual Cost from Monthly Cost**
* Use of **GROUP BY and HAVING**
* Use of **JOINS for multiple tables**
* Use of **SUBQUERIES**

Example:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
```
